# My Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website built with Next.js and a stack that includes TypeScript, SASS, PostCSS, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint-Staged, and Stylelint.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language.
- **SASS:** A CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.
- **PostCSS:** A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.
- **ESLint:** A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- **Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter for JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS.
- **Husky:** A tool that enables you to enforce Git hooks.
- **Lint-Staged:** A tool to run linters on pre-committed files.
- **Stylelint:** A CSS linter that helps identify and fix errors in stylesheets.

## Features
